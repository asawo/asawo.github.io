### About
A tribute page for the band [Red Hot Chili Peppers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers). A project for myself to relearn html/css/js and get back into studying development.

### What I used
- HTML
- CSS
- JS (minimal)
- Bootstrap 4

### Future plans
I will most likely revisit this project to flesh this page out once I have more ideas & skills in (hopfully) the near future.
